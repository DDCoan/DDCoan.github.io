Hi! I am a PhD student at :austria: ISTA & :de: MPI-IS, 
supervised by [Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com) and [Georg Martius](https://al.is.mpg.de). 

My research focuses on identifiability in representation learning and the applicability of causal representation learning for scientific discovery.

Other research interests that are not necessary relavant for my PhD include: social psychology, dream interpretation and color theory.
