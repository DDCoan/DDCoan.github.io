Hi! I am a PhD student at ISTA:austria: & MPI-IS:de:,
supervised by [Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com) and [Georg Martius](https://al.is.mpg.de).

My research focuses on identifiability in representation learning and the applicability of causal representation learning for scientific discovery.

Other research interests that are not necessary relevant for my PhD include: social psychology, dream interpretation and color theory.

Overall, I am an enjoyable human being who likes staring at the stars and thinking about philosophical questions.
